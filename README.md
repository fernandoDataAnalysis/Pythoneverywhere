The project carried out is the analysis of a product sales company using Python. 
In this project we start from the most basic queries in python to end up with a complex analysis of the business, making more complex queries and creating the necessary visualizations to understand and show the results.
In this repository you can find all the files, python queries, visualizations and the final report of the project.
